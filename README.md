## Agenda
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into e-commerce sales data. It aims to present key business metrics, identify trends, and highlight areas for optimization, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Objectives
- Visualize key sales metrics such as total sales, profit, and profit margin.
- Analyze sales performance across different segments, regions, and product categories.
- Provide a detailed breakdown of sales trends over time, helping to identify high-performing periods and customer segments.
- Offer interactive filters to explore data based on various dimensions such as year, region, and customer segment.

## Problem Statement
